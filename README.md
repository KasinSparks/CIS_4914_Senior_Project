# CIS_4914_Senior_Project
A rogue-like deck-building card game that draws inspiration from elements relating to entomology, where the cards are grouped by insect orders (Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera, etc.). Players are tasked with navigating through a procedurally generated map to upgrade their deck and challenge opponents. Strategy must be employed when considering which paths, cards, and actions to take.
